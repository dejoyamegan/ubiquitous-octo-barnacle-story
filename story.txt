There once was a pug named Pugsly. His favorite thing to do is go digging in the backyard. One day he was digging and he found the craziest thing.
{Max}: Pugsly was digging and what he found, as it would seem to many, to be a mass grave. A mass grave of UNEATEN PIES THAT IS HAHAHA YES THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF PUGSLY'S LIFE.
When Pugsly returned home he decided to eat all of the pies. But, his owner looked really sad and put Pugsly in the back of the car. "Where are we going?" he thought.

{Grant} Pugsly was so excited. He ran back and forth from window to window in the car. Pugsly put his nose on the window to try and tell his owner to roll it down. Eventually the window lowered and Pugsly stuck his big head outside the window and OH BOYYY he got excited. "Whats THAT!" and "THAT!" and "THAT!" he thought, and barked at every car that passed. All of a sudden the window began to rise and the car slowed to a stop. "Look we're here" his owner said.
